# 📈 Progress & Error Logs

## 2026-01-15: UI Debugging Session
- **Trial 1**: Attempted to use fixed red box for Sidebar Menu.
- **Result**: Success on button, but side effect styled ALL header buttons in red.
- **Lesson**: Avoid broad `header button` selectors.
- **Trial 2**: Attempted to hide Streamlit Cloud Badge.
- **Result**: Hidden successfully, but navigation menu also disappeared.
- **Lesson**: `stSidebarUserContent` is too broad; need more specific class targeting in the future (though currently rolled back for safety).

## 2026-01-16: Protocol Activation
- [x] Adopted "Planning with Files" (Manus Pattern).
- [x] Updated Auto-update schedule to Hourly.
