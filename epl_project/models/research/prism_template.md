# 🌈 Prism Spectral Analysis Template

> **Prism Hypothesis**: Understanding is not simplification, but the simultaneous maintenance of all resolutions.

## 📡 Low-Frequency Spectrum (Strategic Intent)
*   **User Intent**: *What is the core decision this analysis supports?*
*   **Semantic Hypothesis**: *What is the "why" behind this study?*
*   **Global Context**: [[GEMINI.md]], [[spec.md]]

---

## 💎 The Refraction Layer (Mapping Logic)
*   **Abstraction to Detail**: *How did we translate the "why" into Python code?*
*   **Spectrum Shift**: *Refracting the strategic goal into specific data points.*
