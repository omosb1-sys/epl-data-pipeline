## Plan Mode

- Before writing any code or performing complex analysis, present your implementation/analysis plan in bullet points.
- Keep the plan extremely concise and prioritize clarity.
- At the end of each plan, list any unresolved questions or assumptions that need user confirmation.

## Questioning Culture

- If a task is ambiguous or contains conflicting requirements, do not guess. Ask for clarification.
- Specifically for data analysis: If a data processing rule or statistical threshold is not defined, confirm with the user before proceeding.
