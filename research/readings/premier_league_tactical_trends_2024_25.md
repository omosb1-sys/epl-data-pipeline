## 1. 📋 Core Formations & Structures
*   **4-2-3-1 Dominance**: 51.6% of teams now use this as their primary shape. Usage has evolved from static positions to fluid roles (e.g., Brighton's 4-2-3-1 to 4-1-2-3 transition).
*   **Hybrid Man-to-Man Marking**: Teams press zonally but switch to strict man-marking based on specific 'triggers' (e.g., when the ball moves back or to a specific player).

## 2. ⚡️ Attacking Evolution
*   **Counter-Attack Resurgence**: Increase in goals from fast breaks (88 goals already recorded). Systems are becoming 'less cautious' to exploit transitions.
*   **Set Piece Centricity**: ~33% of goals now come from set pieces. Innovative 'set piece coaches' are revolutionizing corner and free-kick routines.
*   **The Long Throw Weapon**: Usage rates have doubled in the last 10 years (avg 3.03/game). Brentford is a primary exponent of this 'old-school' but high-xG tactic.

## 3. 🛡️ Defensive Trends
*   **Mid-block Supremacy**: Shift away from extreme high-pressing to 'congested mid-blocks' to disrupt central build-up.
*   **Goalkeeper Distribution**: Return to 'Long Kicks' (Direct play) to bypass high-pressing lines and trigger second-ball wins in high areas.

## 4. 📊 Data Insights
*   **Progressive Metrics**: xG (Expected Goals) is no longer enough; 'Progressive Carries' and 'Passes into Zone 14' are the new gold standards for elite performance tracking.
